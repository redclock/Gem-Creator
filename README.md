Unity Gem Creator is a tool for creating gem materials in Unity.  
* It controls the shape, bevel, margin, etc. 
of the gem through parameterization, and builds the gem mesh model
* Generates normal maps based on the shape of the gem, 
and can control the smooth transition between faces
* Provides a material for rendering realistic gems in 2D Sprites,
including parameters such as color, scattering, refraction, and roughness

The goal of this tool is to provide a simple and efficient way to create and render gem elements in 2D games.
